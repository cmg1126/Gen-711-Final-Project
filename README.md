# Background

We were interested in the cyanobacteria research conducted by Valdez-Cano et al on North Atlatnic lakes. The research centers around using metagenomic approaches to identify whcih cyanbacteria are present in the serveyed lakes, as well as assesing their potnential to produce toxins. Cyanobacterial blooms are becoming more common in lakes and when they occur, there are numerous probems they can pose to humans and other animals in the surroudnng ecosystems. These bacteria are known to produce sedondary metabolites that are toxic to humans and other animals in large quantities like microsystin, saxitoxins, and nodularins. In addition to this, cyanobacteria heavily contribute to the eutrophication of lakes, which is the process when a lake loses much of its dissovled oxygen content due to bacterial and algae blooms on the surface blocking sunlight from reaching the auquatic plant life. This process ends up killing most of the life below the surface, leaving behind a toxic body of water.
